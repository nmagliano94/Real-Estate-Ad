Created an ad using MJML for a fake real estate group promoting new listings. This ad would be sent out via email and was tested in PutsMail to ensure everything was rendering properly across all of the major email clients.

The images were put into TinyPNG to compress the size of the files without ruining the quality. They were then uploaded and hosted on PostImages.org.
